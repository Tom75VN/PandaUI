## Three interfaces, one addon

Pick the look you want in the settings; every feature works in all three.

- **Classic WoW**: keep the native interface you know, with all of PandaUI's features.
- **Modern**: a clean, minimalist flat design.
- **Modern WoW**: the look and feel of the Retail interface.

| Classic WoW | Modern | Modern WoW |
|---|---|---|

## Main features

### Visual Edit Mode

Move any element, snap it to a grid or place it freely. Unit frames, action bars, bags, cast bars, XP and reputation bars, the quest tracker and more all live in one edit mode, and the layout is kept across reloads.

### Quick Binding

Hover an action slot and press a key. No trip through nested menus.

### Settings in one place

PandaUI's options sit inside the game settings window, next to Video, Sound and Interface. Switch theme, toggle features, and open Edit Mode from the same screen. The interface is available in **English, French, Russian and Chinese**.

Control the number of buttons, rows, size, spacing and cooldown display for each bar.

### Unit frames, nameplates and combat feedback

- Modern unit frames with real enemy HP and mana numbers.
- Nameplates, colour-coded debuffs, a cast bar and a swing timer.
- Party frames with buffs, debuffs, heal prediction and HoT timers.

### Raid frames

Up to 8 groups of 5, with class-coloured health, power, heal prediction, your own HoTs, debuffs and dispel highlights.

### Talent build advisor and equipment sets

Follow a Leveling, PvP or Raid build: the advisor highlights the talent to pick next and flags points spent outside the build. Save and swap equipment sets from the Character window.
