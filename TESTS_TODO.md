# pandaUI tests to do

In-game tests still owed on OctoWoW. Tick an item once it passes. Report a
failure with its number and what you saw (exact error text if any); every
result is recorded in `knowledge.json` (`USER_CONFIRMED_INGAME`).

## Nameplate Tank Mode (coded 2026-10-28, not yet tested)

Code: `modules/nameplates.lua` (`style.TankKey`), `modules/nameplatesettings.lua`.
Knowledge record: `nameplates.tank_mode_guid_target_flags`. Probe:
`/prp platetank` (in `PlatePlaceProbe.lua`, `/reload` is enough).

Probes 2026-10-28 (modern-wow): green on you, red on a party member, idle mobs ordinary and nonp passed. Still owed: blue (TM4), pet victim (TM3), TM5-TM7, TM9, TM10.

- [x] TM1. `/reload`. `/pui` > Nameplates > Tank Mode: page shows Nampower status, Enable, Aggro, No Aggro, Inactive Enemies, Inactive. Tick Enable.
- [x] TM2. Near a pack, out of combat: plates keep muted red (hostile) and yellow (neutral).
- [ ] TM3. `/prp platetank`. Pull 3+ mobs. Mob on you: green. Mob on your pet or a party member: red. Taunt/pull it back: green within a moment.
- [ ] TM4. Tick Inactive Enemies. Stun, sheep, sap, fear or blind one mob: blue. Root, snare, silence or disarm alone: stays green/red. Untick: back to green/red at once.
- [ ] TM5. Kill a mob: its plate loses green/red/blue. Neutral mob: yellow until attacked.
- [ ] TM6. Players, pets, totems and mobs another player tagged keep their usual colours.
- [ ] TM7. Change each colour picker: visible plates follow at once. `/reload`: settings kept.
- [x] TM8. `/prp platetank stop`, then `/prp platetank nonp` in a pull, wait 12 s, then `/prp reload`.
- [ ] TM9. Repeat TM3 once in each theme: classic-wow, modern, modern-wow.
- [ ] TM10. Untick Enable: every plate returns to its usual colour.

## Game Settings search (coded 2026-10-25, passed in game 2026-10-25)

Code: `modules/gamesettingslist.lua`, `modules/settings.lua`. Knowledge
record: `settings.gamesettings_search_only_open_native_leaf`.

- [x] G1. `/reload`. Esc > Options (opens on Video). Type `chat` in the search: Interface lists only its Chat sub-row, and it opens.
- [x] G2. Clear the search, open Video > Display, then type an option from another leaf (e.g. `combat text`): only matching sub-rows show, the first opens with that option.
- [x] G3. Type a Panda UI option label (e.g. `font`): Panda UI lists only pages holding it; click each, it opens. Note any hitch on the first letter typed.
- [x] G4. Type a pandaQuest and a pandaMap option label: their category lists only the matching page. Disable one addon, relaunch: its category never appears.
- [x] G5. Type `move forward`: Key Bindings is listed and its list shows that binding.
- [x] G6. `/pui` (opens on Panda UI), type a Video option: does it show? Then click Video once and retype: it must show.
- [x] G7. Clear the search: every category and sub-row returns, nothing stray drawn on any page, the game menu did not pop up.
